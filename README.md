# Purpose

This repository is part of the [Hobby Hoster]()(https://github.com/skamensky/hobby-hoster) project.

This particular repo is specifically tailored for hosting a custom LittleLink server. LittleLink is an open-source DIY alternative to services like Linktree and Bio.fm, allowing users to create a simple, self-hosted landing page with links to their social media profiles, websites, and other important content.

This site is hosted at [links.kelev.dev](https://links.kelev.dev/).
